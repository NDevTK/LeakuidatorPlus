# Leakuidator+ 

Leakuidator+ helps users to protect themselves against cross-site leaks, a class of vulnerabilities derived from side-channels built into the web platform.

When browsing the web, Leakuidator+ keeps users safe against deanonymization attacks by protecting their online identities associated with storage sites such as Google Drive, One Drive, and Dropbox; media sharing sites such as YouTube, Google Photos, Amazon Photos, and Flickr; code-hosting repositories such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Assembla; social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, and other websites.

Leakuidator+ has two modes of operation, Relaxed and Exact, which reflect the criteria used for identifying potentially dangerous requests made by a website. For each dangerous request identified, the user has the option to let the request pass through or to continue being protected. Prior user decisions can be recorded for future use, and are accessible for editing through the options page.
